# 1. Research Pivot
I have **pivoted** my research scope. I agree that I should move away from addressing the "intent to manipulate" (which is a business/legal issue) and focus strictly on an HCI-centred approach: equipping designers with the tools to evaluate and handle these new technological challenges.

# 2. Revised Research Framework
Here is my revised research framework, focusing on **actionable evaluation** rather than abstract frameworks:

### 2.1 The "What": Shifting from Static Patterns to Dynamic AI Risks
I am shifting my theoretical anchor from Gray et al. (2018) to **Duane et al. (2025)**. While Gray focuses on static UI, Duane’s concept of "AI-powered nudges" and "Hypernudges" addresses how Agentic AI dynamically adjusts manipulation based on real-time data. My focus is now on helping designers evaluate whether an AI agent is exerting "Hidden Influence" (Susser, 2019) that they might not have intended.

### 2.2 The "Who": Addressing Vulnerability and the "Halo Effect"
I will specifically target the risks identified by **Ellis et al.** regarding the "Halo Effect." Since older adults often lower their privacy guard due to trust in healthcare systems, they have lower "manipulation defense." My proposed evaluation tool will specifically detect design elements that exploit this over-trust.

### 2.3 The "How": From Principles to Heuristics
Recognizing that UX designers cannot apply high-level governance (like NIST) in a daily Design Sprint, I aim to translate these principles into **"Design Heuristics"** or an **"Audit Tool."**

# 3. Current Literature Review
I am currently reviewing recent literature (2023-2025) from **CHI, DIS, and CSCW**, focusing on:

* **AI Auditing Tools for Designers:** How to "test" for breakdown points (Zubatiy, 2023) pre-deployment.
* **Seams & Positive Friction:** Exploring the idea that seamlessness isn't always good. We may need "Beautiful Seams" (or distinct cues) to break the Halo Effect and remind older adults that they are interacting with an AI.

# 4. Refined Contribution Statement
Based on the above, I have crystallized my contribution as follows:

> "My contribution is a set of **heuristic evaluation guidelines tailored for Agentic AI**, that enables **UX practitioners and interaction designers** to systematically identify and mitigate **dynamic manipulation risks (such as hyper-nudging)** specifically for **vulnerable older adults** during the pre-deployment phase, for the **HCI and Responsible AI community**."

# 5. Next Steps
I will proceed with the literature review on "Contestability" and "Design Friction" as the next step.
