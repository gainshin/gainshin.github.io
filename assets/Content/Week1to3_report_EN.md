## 1.2 Key Findings

### Completed Milestones

1. **Classification System**: We established a systematic paper classification framework (Tier 1-3 + Unaccepted).

2. **Round 2 Evaluation**: Twenty-one papers were evaluated and classified:
   - **Tier 1** (6 papers): Peixoto 2025, Bhattacharya 2024, Brewer 2022 CHI EA, Gray 2018, Susser 2019, Brignull 2024
   - **Tier 2** (4 papers): An 2025, Zubatiy 2023, Even 2022, Wildenbos 2018
   - **Tier 3** (1 paper): Brewer 2022
   - **Unaccepted** (7 papers): Excluded with clear rationale
   - **Pending** (3 papers): Awaiting final classification

3. **Core Literature Collection**:
   - **Theme 1**: 8 papers collected (including Huang 2025, Du 2024, Brewer CHI EA).
   - **Theme 2**: Three core papers (Gray 2018, Susser 2019, Brignull 2024) were located, downloaded, and rated Tier 1.
   - **Theme 3**: Wildenbos (2018) was evaluated as Tier 2.
   - **Theme 4**: Six papers collected, including key grey literature (NIST, WHO, CIFAR, Amii).

4. **Source Diversity**: Papers were identified from top-tier venues including CHI, CSCW, and JMIR.

5. **Grey Literature**: NIST AI RMF (2023), WHO Guidance (2021), CIFAR (2023), and Amii (2023) are now in Zotero.

6. **Progress Summary**: Theme 2 core papers are fully evaluated (Tier 1). Theme 3's Wildenbos (2018) is confirmed as Tier 2. The current Tier 1 ratio is 29%, with Tier 2 at 19%.

7. **Theme 3 Insight**: While most Theme 3 papers were marked Unaccepted in Round 2 evaluation, Wildenbos (2018)'s MOLD-US framework offers a valuable structured approach to aging-related usability barriers, which can be extended to conversational agents.

### Collection Results

1. **Theme 2: AI Dark Patterns & Manipulation** — Three core papers (Gray 2018, Susser 2019, Brignull 2024) are now in Zotero. Each received Tier 1 classification after dimensional analysis, establishing 60% coverage for the theoretical foundation (3 of 5 target papers).

2. **Theme 4: Grey Literature** — CIFAR (2023) and Amii (2023) documents are now available in Zotero.

3. **Theme 3: MOLD-US Framework** — Wildenbos et al. (2018) received Tier 2 classification.

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Theme 2 Supplementary Search** (High Priority) — To achieve 80-100% coverage, we need 1-2 additional papers (e.g., Gull 2025, FAccT conference papers).
   - **Rationale**: While core literature is complete, the research proposal emphasizes dark patterns as the theoretical foundation. Thus, supplementary search is a high priority.
   - **Actions**: Confirm Gull (2025) access; execute FAccT search.

2. **Theme 3 Re-evaluation** (Highest Priority) — Five out of six Theme 3 papers were marked Unaccepted for lacking direct links to conversational AI design or the analysis framework.
   - **Context**: Ellis et al. (2025) was reclassified from "core" to "Unaccepted" due to stricter criteria requiring a link between design practices and perception gaps.
   - **Approach**: Search for literature explicitly connecting interface design to older adults' privacy risk perception or design interventions.

3. **Tier 1 Literature Ratio** (High Priority) — The current 29% ratio (6 papers) is below the 40-50% target.
   - **Target**: Approximately 10 Tier 1 papers total (need 4 more).
   - **Focus**: Theme 3 (increase from 0 to 2) > Theme 1 (increase from 1 to 2-3).

4. **Search Documentation** (Medium Priority) — Detailed records for Round 2 searches, author searches, and grey literature acquisition need to be retrospectively added.

# 2. Research Objectives and Tasks

## 2.1 Week 1-3 Planned Tasks

According to INFS 603 course requirements, this phase needs to complete:

1. **Read Background Literature** — Establish foundational knowledge in AI health services
2. **Learn Key Concepts** — Understand HCI and UX applications in healthcare
3. **Identify Seed Papers** — Select 5-8 core papers per thematic area
4. **Citation Tracking Preparation** — Establish starting points for backward/forward chaining
5. **Maintain Search Records** — Ensure transparency and reproducibility of research process
6. **Develop Concept Map** — Organize relationships between themes

## 2.2 Task Execution Logic

```
Week 1-2: Execute preliminary searches → Identify candidate papers → Preliminary classification
    ↓
Week 2 End: Review search results → Diagnose problems → Adjust strategies
    ↓
Week 3: Supplementary searches → Confirm seed papers → Prepare citation tracking
```

This phased approach allows us to first establish a broad literature foundation before refining our search strategies. The mid-term review helps prevent directional drift, while ensuring adequate seed papers are identified before Week 4's deep citation tracking.

### Key Literature Notes

**Ellis et al. (2025) - "The Halo Effect"**: This paper provides empirical evidence that older adults underestimate privacy risks due to trust in healthcare institutions (halo effect). It directly supports the core argument that UX design practices fail to account for older adults' privacy risk perception.

**Wildenbos et al. (2018) - MOLD-US Framework**: This framework systematically identifies barrier factors affecting older adults' mobile health usability, providing a structured tool for analyzing design practice gaps.

   - **Key Findings**: Older adults prefer positive health representations (Subjectivity) and require understandable, verifiable data summaries (Intelligibility).
   - **Relevance**: Directly addresses persuasive design (managing emotional well-being) and transparency (intelligibility of algorithms).

### Theme 2: AI Dark Patterns & Manipulation

1. **Gray et al. (2018)** - "The Dark (Patterns) Side of UX Design" - CHI 2018 - **Tier 1**
   - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3174108
   - This seminal work provides a classification system for dark patterns in UX design. It addresses harm through pattern identification, trust through exploitation analysis, and design through systematic categorization.
2. **Susser et al. (2019)** - "Technology, Autonomy, and Manipulation" - Internet Policy Review - **Tier 1**
   - DOI: https://doi.org/10.14763/2019.2.1410
   - Theoretical framework for technological manipulation, distinguishes legitimate influence from manipulative practices.
   - Covers all three analytical dimensions: harm/autonomy, trust/manipulation, and design/ethics.
3. **Brignull (2023/2024)** - "Deceptive Patterns: exposing the tricks tech companies use to control you" - Book (Testimonium Ltd) - **Tier 1**
   - Publisher: Testimonium Ltd (Eastbourne, England)
   - Edition: First edition: 2 January 2024
   - ISBN: 978-1-7394544-1-8, 978-1-7394544-0-1, 978-1-7394544-2-5
   - Collected in epub format and updated to Zotero.
   - Practical classification of deceptive design, provides practical framework for identifying and analyzing manipulative design elements.
   - Provides comprehensive dimensional coverage: harm/pattern recognition, trust/deception, and design/practice.

**Status**: All core literature completed Tier evaluation, all rated Tier 1.

### Theme 3: Digital Health, Aging, Usability & Chatbots

1. **Ellis et al. (2025)** - "The Halo Effect: Perceptions of Information Privacy Among Healthcare Chatbot Users" - J Am Geriatr Soc - **Unaccepted**
   - **Exclusion Reason**: While privacy perception research is important, if the literature does not link to **how interface design affects privacy risk perception** (transparency dimension), it cannot directly support the research argument. Ellis et al. (2025) provides empirical evidence that older adults underestimate privacy risks due to trust in healthcare institutions (halo effect), but does not analyze how specific interface design elements (such as transparency mechanisms, persuasive design patterns) shape or exploit this perception bias.
   - **Research Question Impact**: This exclusion has important implications for the research question's argumentative logic. In the original plan, Ellis et al. (2025) was considered "core literature directly supporting the research question" because it provides empirical evidence of older adults' privacy perception bias. However, Round 2 evaluation emphasizes that the core of the research question is "**gaps in interface design practices**," not merely the existence of perception bias. Therefore, we need to find literature that **simultaneously covers privacy perception bias and interface design impact**, or adjust the research question formulation to clearly distinguish "perception problems" from "design problems."
   - **Alternative Approach**: Need to find literature focusing on "how interface design affects older adults' privacy risk perception" or research on "how design interventions correct perception biases."
2. **Wildenbos et al. (2018)** - "Aging barriers influencing mobile health usability for older adults: A literature based framework (MOLD-US)" - Int J Med Inform - **Tier 2**
   - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2018.03.012
   - Coverage: Usability/Harm (highly relevant), Transparency/Trust (indirectly relevant), Persuasive Design/Manipulation (potentially relevant but not explicit).
   - MOLD-US framework systematically identifies four major categories of aging barriers (Cognition, Motivation, Physical Ability, Perception), can be directly applied to analyze usability issues in conversational agents.
   - High impact (555+ citations), standard reference in this field.
3. **Sakaguchi-Tang et al. (2017)** - "Patient Portal Use and Experience Among Older Adults: Systematic Review" - JMIR Med Inform - **Unaccepted** (primarily focuses on traditional GUI usability barriers, not conversational agents).
4. **Kidman et al. (2024)** - "When and Why Adults Abandon Lifestyle Behavior and Mental Health Mobile Apps" - JMIR - **Unaccepted** (analyzes from behavioral science perspective rather than interface design perspective).
5. **Ma et al. (2023)** - "Artificial intelligence in elderly healthcare: A scoping review" - Ageing Res Rev - **Unaccepted** (focuses on AI technology applications rather than interaction design).
6. **Turner et al. (2020)** - "Patient Portal Barriers and Group Differences" - JMIR - **Unaccepted** (lacks AI transparency or persuasive design discussion).

**Note**: Most Theme 3 literature was marked as Unaccepted in Round 2 evaluation because they do not directly link to conversational AI interface design or the three-dimensional analysis framework. Wildenbos et al. (2018)'s MOLD-US framework was rated Tier 2, providing a structured method to identify and analyze usability barriers for older users, but needs critical extension to cover transparency and persuasive design dimensions in conversational agent contexts.

**Key Change**: Ellis et al. (2025)'s transition from "core literature" in the original plan to "Unaccepted" reflects stricter evaluation criteria: the core of the research question is "**gaps in interface design practices**," not merely "the existence of perception problems." This requires literature to explicitly link interface design elements with the research question's three dimensions (harm, trust, design).

# 5. Current Status Analysis and Improvement Strategies

## 5.1 Theme 2: Dark Patterns Literature Collection

### Current Progress

The preliminary bibliography in the research proposal listed Gray et al. (2018), Susser et al. (2019), and Brignull (2024) as core literature. These items were located, downloaded, and evaluated:

- **Gray et al. (2018)** - Added to Zotero, rated **Tier 1**
- **Susser et al. (2019)** - Added to Zotero, rated **Tier 1**
- **Brignull (2023/2024)** - Added to Zotero, rated **Tier 1**

**Current Coverage**: 60% (3/5 core papers). The theoretical foundation is established. We plan to supplement 1-2 papers to reach the 80-100% target.

### Key Achievements

**Effective Strategies**:

Several approaches proved effective. Author-based searches using names ("Colin Gray", "Daniel Susser") helped locate papers directly in ACM Digital Library. We obtained papers through direct access to the Internet Policy Review website and Testimonium Ltd publisher. Beyond traditional databases, we confirmed Brignull (2024) as a book from Testimonium Ltd and collected it in epub format.

**Completed Core Literature**:

- **Gray et al. (2018)**: Downloaded via ACM Digital Library, rated Tier 1.
- **Susser et al. (2019)**: Downloaded via Internet Policy Review, rated Tier 1.
- **Brignull (2023/2024)**: Collected in epub format, rated Tier 1.

### Supplementation Strategies (Reaching 80-100% Coverage)

**Strategy 2: Layered Search Method (Supplementing Other Literature)**

```
Step 1 (Broad):
"dark patterns" OR "deceptive design" OR "manipulative design"
→ First establish dark patterns foundational literature base (not limited to health or older adults)

Step 2 (Medium):
("dark patterns" OR "deceptive design") AND (digital health OR eHealth)
→ Narrow to health domain

Step 3 (Precise):
("dark patterns") AND ("consent" OR "privacy" OR "autonomy")
→ Focus on ethical dimensions relevant to research question
```

**Strategy 3: Conference-Specific Search**

```
ACM Digital Library:
- Conference: CHI (2018-2025) + "dark patterns"
- Conference: FAccT (2020-2025) + "manipulation" OR "autonomy"
- Conference: DIS (2018-2025) + "deceptive design"
```

## 5.2 Revisiting Excluded Papers

### Assessment

Some papers initially marked as Unaccepted warrant reconsideration, specifically:

**Case: Ellis et al. (2025) - "The Halo Effect"**

| Item         | Content                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Original Reason | "Exclude if it does not link to how interface design affects privacy risk perception"                                                                         |
| Issue        | Criteria too strict for seed paper selection                                                                                                                   |
| Rationale for Inclusion | 1. Empirical evidence of older adults' privacy perception bias<br>2. Supports research question regarding design failures<br>3. Conceptual framework (halo effect)<br>4. Starting point for citation tracking |

### Refined Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

| Criteria Dimension | Seed Papers                         | Background Papers             | Exclude           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| HCI Depth          | Has clear interface/interaction design discussion | Mentions design but not in depth | Completely no design perspective |
| User Group Relevance | Focuses on older adults or has older adult subsample | General adults (generalizable) | Children, professional users |
| Health Domain Relevance | Health/medical applications primary | Includes health cases         | Completely unrelated |
| Citation Value     | Cited >10 or cites >20 related papers | Cited <10                     | Citation-poor     |
| Problem Relevance  | Directly addresses or exposes an aspect of research question | Provides conceptual/methodological support | Completely unrelated |

**Key Principles**:
- **Seed Paper Stage**: Inclusion criteria should be **lenient** — goal is to establish starting points for citation network
- **Week 3-6 Citation Tracking Stage**: Then use strict criteria to filter expanded literature
- **Week 7-10 Deep Analysis Stage**: Retain only the most core 40-50 papers

## 5.3 Database Selection and Search Scope

### Progress Review

**Paper Source Distribution**:
- ACM Conferences/Journals (CHI, CSCW, TiiS): Good coverage
- JMIR Series: Good coverage
- IEEE Conferences: Less frequent
- Domain-Specific Journals: Gerontechnology, Universal Access (absent)

**Potential Issues**:
1. Over-reliance on single database.
2. Underutilization of IEEE Xplore for AI ethics papers.
3. Scopus "Conference Proceedings" filter not fully utilized.

### Improved Database Usage Strategy

| Theme                                         | Primary Database              | Secondary Database              | Supplementary Sources               |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |

| Theme 2: AI Dark Patterns & Manipulation     | **ACM DL (Required)**       | IEEE Xplore                     | Google Scholar                      |
| Theme 3: Digital Health, Aging, Usability & Chatbots | Web of Science (Health)      | JMIR Publications               | PubMed                              |
| Theme 4: Governance, Risk & Responsible AI   | **Organization Websites**    | IEEE Xplore (Standards)         | arXiv                               |

## 5.4 Alignment Check with Research Question

### Coverage of Five Key Dimensions

| Key Dimension          | Required Literature Type                | Current Coverage                      | Gap                       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1. Older Adults' AI Literacy | Empirical studies of older adults' understanding/misunderstanding of AI | Medium                        | Missing AI literacy measurement studies |
| 2. Privacy Risk Perception | Older adults' privacy perception biases  | Good (with Ellis 2025)           | Need more studies on design impact on perception |
| 3. Design Practice Gaps | Papers critically analyzing current design | Insufficient                    | **Dark patterns literature missing** |
| 4. High-Level Principles | WHO, NIST frameworks                     | Missing                        | Grey literature not yet downloaded |
| 5. Interface-Level Implementation | Specific design patterns/interface cases | Medium                        | Need more design pattern literature |

# 6. Revised Search Strategies

## 6.1 Core Principle Adjustments

| Current Strategy             | Problem                       | Improved Strategy                       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| All conditions connected with AND | Intersection too small        | **Layered Search**: Broad first, then narrow |
| One search contains all concepts | Misses partially matching papers | **Multiple Simplified Searches** → Merge results |
| Simultaneously require multiple domain terms | Cross-disciplinary papers may use only one term | **OR expand synonyms** + fewer AND |

## 6.2 Theme 1: HCI & Conversational Agents/Intelligent Systems (Older Adults) — Revised Search Strategy

### Layer 1: Broad Exploration

**Web of Science / Scopus**

## 6.6 Cross-Theme Integration Strategy

### Do Not Use One Search String to Integrate All Themes

**Improved Strategy**:

1. **First Establish Separate Literature Bases for Each Theme**
   - Theme 1 → 50 papers
   - Theme 2 → 30 papers
   - Theme 3 → 60 papers
   - Theme 4 → 40 papers
   - **Total: ~180 candidate papers**

2. **Identify Cross-Theme Papers Through Zotero Tags**
   ```
   Zotero Advanced Search:
   Tags contain #Topic1 AND #Topic2 → Identify cross-theme papers
   ```

3. **Targeted Small-Scale Integration Searches**
   ```
   Integration Search I (Older Adults + Privacy + AI):
