Hi Prof. Moffatt,

Thank you for the very direct feedback today — it was very helpful and gave me much clearer direction.
I want to confirm my takeaways and outline what I plan to do before our next meeting.

What I heard

1.The framework is too broad for its solid evidence base. Each piece is supported by roughly one paper, which is not enough to treat any of them as established facts. I need to stop building outward and start building downward.

2.The Halo Effect claim is over-extended. Ellis 2025 proposed it as a possible explanation — not a tested finding. I was treating it as a foundational fact when it's actually an unvalidated hypothesis. The independence-motivation explanation (older adults trading privacy to stay in their homes) is equally plausible and I had not given it adequate weight.

"The Halo Effect claim is over‑extended. Ellis 2025 proposed it as a possible explanation — not a tested finding.

The independence‑motivation explanation (older adults trading privacy to stay in their homes) is equally plausible and I had not given it adequate weight.

I also now realize that no one has treated the Halo Effect as an older‑adult‑specific trust mechanism. Building my L1 vulnerability around it overstates what the literature can support, and any reasoning chain like “older adults lack AI literacy → are especially vulnerable to a halo effect → cannot act as auditors” has, at best, very limited and time‑sensitive validity given how quickly AI literacy is evolving."

3.Literature review should use a traditional thematic structure, not the 4-layer architecture. The framework doesn't yet have enough converging evidence to serve as an organizing principle for the review.

4.I need to pick one narrow question with the strongest evidence and explore it deeply, rather than trying to cover all four layers and three unrealized concepts.

What I plan to do

1. Narrow my focus. Based on the audit, I will select one well-evidenced area (likely around the trust/privacy trade-off in healthcare AI for older adults, where Ellis and Wong provide initial evidence on trust and privacy, and Chong's recent bias-mitigation work offers counter-evidence about older adults' capacity to engage critically with AI outputs) and build my literature review depth there.

2. Audit every claim in my current framework and label it as either:
   - supported by multiple independent studies,
   - supported by a single paper only, or
   - proposed but untested.
This will tell me where the solid ground actually is and guide what stays in the review vs. what gets flagged as open.

3. Reframe the Halo Effect as one candidate explanation alongside the independence-motivation hypothesis (older adults trading privacy to maintain autonomy at home). I'll present both and flag that neither has been conclusively tested for this population, rather than treating halo effect as the default explanation.

4. Define my target population more precisely. My current thinking is community-dwelling older adults (65+) who are relatively healthy and financially stable, using healthcare AI to maintain independence — but I'd welcome your input on whether this scoping makes sense.

5. Prepare a shorter, more focused update for next time — I'll aim for 10–15 minutes with one clear thread rather than 30 minutes across everything.

I'll also look into the bias-mitigation work with older adults that you mentioned — it seems directly relevant as counter-evidence to the assumption that older adults cannot engage critically with AI outputs.

Thank you again for pushing me to tighten this up. Happy Spring Break!

Best,
