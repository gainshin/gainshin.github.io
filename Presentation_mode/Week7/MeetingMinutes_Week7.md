# Week 7 Meeting Minutes

**Date:** 2026-02-26 (Thursday)  
**Attendees:** Supervisor, Student (Hank)  
**Format:** Online, screen-sharing presentation (~30 min)  
**Next Meeting:** 2 weeks later (after Spring Break)

## 1 Presentation Summary

Student presented the Week 7 progress in two parts:

### Part A — Three focused report sections

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Cross-Layer Fracture Analysis | Identified 4 fracture dynamics where the 4-layer framework contradicts itself; layers form a causal loop, not parallel tracks. Highlighted *Pang 2021* as key mitigation but only on capability side — motivation gap remains open. |
| Proxy Auditor Model | Proposed delegation of audit responsibility from older adults to trusted intermediaries, acknowledging WeAudit's young-volunteer sample does not transfer. *Baghestani 2024* showed proxy pairs are fragile (dominant-follower failure in 50 % of mixed-age pairs). |
| Unrealized Design Concepts | Three untested concepts — Elder-Friendly Friction (attention-layer only), In-Situ Contestability (retrospective via Decision Journal; real-time still open), Halo Effect Inoculation (most speculative, pre-interaction trust calibration). |

### Part B — Zotero 5C Relation Graph walkthrough

Walked through legend, snowball view (R1→R6, 30 core papers), and 7 relation-type filters (conceptual → empirical → design → governance → parallel → framework → methodological) with summary tables.

### Student's two questions to supervisor

1. Should Halo Effect Inoculation remain in the lit review as an "identified design gap," or be scoped out entirely due to zero empirical precedent?
2. Should the lit review use the 4-layer architecture as chapter structure, or a more traditional thematic organization?

## 2 Supervisor Feedback — Key Points

### 2.1 Halo Effect: Over-reliance on thin evidence

- The term "Halo Effect" originates from Edward Thorndike (1920); it is a **general human cognitive bias**, not specific to older adults.
- The **only** paper linking halo effect to older adults + healthcare AI is **Ellis 2025**, and that paper:
  - Was not studying halo effect — it was a different research question.
  - The authors *proposed* a halo effect as one possible explanation for unexpected data.
  - They explicitly wrote: *"If true, this Halo effect generates new questions and hypotheses"* — they did **not** claim it as established fact.
  - They acknowledged other explanations exist.
- Student is **leapfrogging** off an unvalidated hypothesis and treating it as an established finding. This is methodologically problematic.

### 2.2 Alternative explanation for older adults' trust in healthcare AI

- An **equally plausible** explanation for why older adults are more willing to trust healthcare AI / share health data: **independence motivation**.
- They are willing to trade privacy if it means staying in their own home. This is a practical, self-preservation trade-off — not necessarily a halo effect.
- Multiple researchers in the field have proposed this alternative (though it's also not definitively proven).
- Older adults trusting government-endorsed healthcare AI may reflect **rational authority assessment** (information literacy teaches looking for authority) rather than irrational bias transfer.

### 2.3 Structural critique: Sand castle without foundation

- **Every piece of the framework is supported by only ~1 paper each.** The framework is broad but on very tenuous ground.
- Science establishes facts through **convergent evidence from multiple studies**, not single-paper support.
- Example: *Pang 2021*'s finding that older adults prefer trial-and-error is treated as established fact, but it's one study.
- The 30-minute presentation length itself signals the scope is too large.
- **Direct quote paraphrased:** "You're trying to build a whole sand castle, and there's no foundation for it."

### 2.4 Scope down — find one piece with strong evidence

- Stop trying to build the entire framework now. **Pick one narrow question** and explore it deeply.
- Identify which pieces have **good evidence** vs. which are **preliminary ideas**.
- Ask for each claim: "Is this really backed by research? Are there **multiple** papers pointing in this direction?"

### 2.5 Existing evidence to consider

- **Chong's recent study** (supervisor's lab): Older adults were incredibly engaged with bias-mitigation tasks, had insightful things to say, and showed strong ability to learn to identify AI bias. This contradicts the assumption that older adults are "completely incapable."
- There is existing (though not deep) research on older adults' willingness to share health data for privacy — primarily interpreted through **independence/staying at home** rather than halo effect.

### 2.6 AI literacy is a moving target

- AI literacy is at a pivotal point. 5 years ago nobody had AI literacy.
- Papers published today may be based on data collected 1–2 years ago — people are catching up fast.
- Keep this temporal context in mind when framing claims.

### 2.7 Define your target population

- Who exactly are "older adults" in your study?
  - Retirement age, relatively healthy, financially stable, wanting to stay home? → Educated, resourced.
  - Low-income, AI as only access? → Different needs entirely.
- Population choice shapes everything. Chong's study participants were self-selected, interested, educated — not representative of all older adults.

### 2.8 Literature review structure → lean traditional

- **Do not use 4-layer framework as chapter structure** — not enough solid evidence to justify it as an organizing principle yet.
- Use a **more traditional thematic literature review** instead.
- It's fine that the lit review is broad. Sketch where evidence is **strong** vs. where there are **preliminary ideas**.
- The framework may be correct eventually, but it needs much more support.

## 3 Action Items

| # | Action | Priority |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Scope down**: Choose ONE narrow, well-evidenced question to explore deeply | Critical |
| 2 | **Audit every claim**: For each assertion in the framework, check if it's supported by ≥2 independent papers or just one | Critical |
| 3 | **Re-evaluate Halo Effect usage**: Reframe Ellis 2025's finding as an unvalidated hypothesis, not an established fact. Consider independence-motivation as alternative explanation | High |
| 4 | **Literature review structure**: Use traditional thematic organization, not 4-layer architecture | High |
| 5 | **Differentiate evidence strength**: In the lit review, clearly distinguish well-evidenced findings vs. preliminary ideas vs. open questions | High |
| 6 | **Define target population** precisely — who are the older adults in this research? | High |
| 7 | **Consider Chong's study** as relevant counter-evidence to "older adults can't audit" assumption | Medium |
| 8 | **Account for temporal context**: AI literacy is evolving rapidly; frame claims accordingly | Medium |
| 9 | Prepare a shorter, more focused presentation for next time (supervisor's implicit expectation) | Medium |

## 4 Key Supervisor Quotes (paraphrased)

> "Every piece of your framework is held up by like one paper. You've got a whole framework, but it's on very tenuous ground."

> "You're trying to build a whole sand castle and there's no foundation for it."

> "Find something lower level that you can build off of."

> "Ellis identified the *possibility* that there might be a halo effect… they do not claim that there is a halo effect."

> "The fact that it took you 30 minutes to go through it all should tell you something."

> "You should be able to give me a progress update in a lot less time because you shouldn't be covering so many different concepts and theories and elements."

## 5 Post-Meeting Evidence Audit (W8 Addition)

Following the meeting, a systematic web search was conducted to verify the supervisor's two key critiques. Results below.

### 5.1 Halo Effect — No direct empirical evidence for older adults + health AI

| Search scope | Result |
|---|---|
| "Halo effect" + older adults + health AI (any venue) | **0 papers** directly testing this hypothesis |
| Ellis 2025 | Only paper mentioning halo effect in this intersection — as a *proposed* explanation, not a tested finding |
| Cross-age halo effect in health AI | NEJM AI (Ayers 2024, N=300) and Nature Medicine (Jungmann 2024, N=2,280) studied AI overtrust in medical advice — **neither did age stratification** |
| Largest age-stratified study | Danish Health cohort (2025, N=39,109, ages 18–89): **older adults were MORE skeptical** of health AI chatbots — opposite of halo effect prediction |
| AARP 2024 survey | Older adults "embrace tech but are skeptical of AI" |
| Trust transfer direction | Guo et al. 2025 (BMC Med Ethics): trust flows AI → physician → hospital (bottom-up), **not** hospital → chatbot (top-down, the halo hypothesis) |

**Conclusion**: Halo effect is a general human cognitive bias (Thorndike 1920), not specific to older adults. No study has tested whether it operates more strongly in older adults. The only large-scale age-stratified data points in the opposite direction.

### 5.2 AI Literacy — Temporal validity problem confirmed

| Finding | Source |
|---|---|
| No AI literacy scale has been tested for temporal validity | Laupichler et al. 2024 (npj Science of Learning) — systematic review of all AI literacy scales |
| Attitudes shift significantly in 2 years | Danish cohort 2022→2024: 37% "uncertain" → majority shifted to positive (OR 3.21) |
| Older adults actively learning | Ng et al. 2025 (N=103, mean age 64): motivated to learn AI but don't know where to start |
| Digital divide widening | Strobel & Strobel 2025: individual differences in digital literacy grow over time, not shrink |

**Conclusion**: Any AI literacy data is a cross-sectional snapshot. Claims based on 2023 data about older adults' AI literacy may not hold in 2025–2026.

### 5.3 Actions taken on Zotero_5C.html

| Card | Change |
|---|---|
| Ellis 2025 (L1) | Halo effect downgraded from established finding to candidate explanation; independence motivation added as alternative; Danish counter-evidence added |
| Sakaguchi-Tang (L1) | Removed direct attribution to halo effect; reframed as open question |
| Wong 2025 (L1) | Reframed convergence with Ellis as shared pattern, not confirmation of halo effect |
| Graph empirical filter | Summary table revised; halo effect marked as untested hypothesis with counter-evidence |
